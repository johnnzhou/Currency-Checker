# Currency Checker V0.8

Thank you for using Currency Checker, a lightweight script based on JSBox on iOS. It helps you keep track of the currency exchange rate you care about.

**How to use**
Download the scripts and import to JSBox. (JSBox preinstalled on your devices)

**Notice**
- All the statistics are sourced from European Central Bank. Please check the actual rate with your local bank.
- In the current version, we only support the exchange between USD and CNY, as keeping track of the real-time exchange rate requires high memory usage. But in the future updates, we may bring other currencies to you.
- Also plotting the line graph of fluctuation of exchange rate in this version is very unstable. As a result, I temporarily deactivate this feature. I will bring this crucial feature back in the upcoming update.

**Known Issues**:
- In this version, you will see “undefined” or “NaN” from time to time. This is because the app is still initiating its database. You can relaunch the app or click the “run” button on the right corner of JSBox environment and reenter the app.
- The push of notification on Currency Checker requires the app to run in the background, which may cause higher battery consumption. If you want to save battery life or don’t want to receive any notifications, you can choose to turn off the notification in the Settings page.
